# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

**Beatmaps** are game levels created for songs and stored in text files with [the `.osu` extension](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)). They have different structure and sometimes may be played only in one [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode).

## Overview

At the core, a beatmap consists of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) of a certain [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode), which are set up accordingly to the [timing](/wiki/Glossary#timing-section) tailored to a specific song. Beatmaps have different aspects, which directly affect user experience.

The hit objects of a beatmap compose [patterns](Pattern), which also vary per game mode and set the tone for overall difficulty, and how a beatmap should be played. The process of playing the beatmap is altered by various [difficulty settings](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup#difficulty) set by the beatmap's author and [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_modifier) toggled by a player.

From the auditory perspective, a beatmap can augment the song by providing one or multiple sets of audio samples, or [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound), that serve as an additional layer of feedback.

Visual components of a beatmap, contrary to its patterns, provide auxiliary experience during gameplay and can be disabled in the [visual settings](/wiki/Visual_Settings) overlay for the most part. Those include:

- [background imagery](Background) and video, which both can act as a playfield;
- [kiai time](/wiki/Kiai_time) and [combo colours](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_colour) that help distinguish different beatmap sections from each other;
- [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboards) that adds motion graphics and special effects, or provides a background story or theme for the song;
- [custom skin](/wiki/Skinning), which changes the appearance of interface and gameplay elements;
- [title text](Title_Text), which presents the song's metadata.

## Beatmapsets

*Main article: [Beatmapsets](Beatmapsets)*

On a higher level, beatmaps are grouped into [beatmapsets](Beatmapsets), and then [submitted](/wiki/Glossary#bss) to the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets). Each beatmapset typically covers one song and holds together several beatmaps with different object placement and gameplay settings. In this context, a beatmap is called a [difficulty](/wiki/Difficulties).

While every beatmapset is attributed to [a single person](Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host), it is often a joint effort: some difficulties may be done by other people working [in collaboration](Beatmap_collaborations) or [separately](Beatmapsets/Guest_difficulty).

### Beatmap category

*Main article: [Beatmap category](Category)*

After submission, a beatmap belongs to one of the following categories, which may change over time:

- [Graveyard](Category#graveyard)
- [Work in Progress / Pending](Category#work-in-progress-and-pending)
- [Qualified](Category#qualified)
- [Ranked](Category#ranked)
- [Approved](Category#approved)
- [Loved](Category#loved)

Some categories have [submission criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and enable the beatmaps to have transient or permanent [leaderboards](#leaderboards). The most popular way of achieving that is the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure), while the second option is to get the beatmap [loved](Category#loved).

## Downloading beatmaps

Beatmaps can be obtained through a few different ways:

### Beatmap listing

Beatmaps from various categories are available from the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) on the website. They can be filtered according to certain conditions (e.g. beatmaps from [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) created by a certain mapper), and then downloaded one by one. [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter) have access to an extended set of filters, such as an ability to see beatmaps on which they achieved a certain rank.

### osu!direct

osu!direct is the beatmap listing built into the game client, which is used for quick access and provides a set of features similar to the listing on the website. It is only available to the [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter).

### Beatmap packs

*Main article: [Beatmap packs](Packs)*

Beatmapsets that were ranked in the same month, or share the same theme (e.g. the same artist), are packed for bulk download into archives, which are called the beatmap packs. The list of all official packs is available on the [website](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs).

### Unofficial sources

There are also secondary sources of beatmaps, which are **neither checked nor operated by the osu!team**. However, they are available on the forums and appreciated by the community. Such sources include:

- third-party beatmap mirrors hosted off a platform;
- player-made packs and compilations shared via [p2p-networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Wikipedia"), such as BitTorrent.

## Beatmaps and community

### Leaderboards

osu! players across all game modes use beatmaps to [rank up globally](/wiki/Performance_points) and [compete against each other](/wiki/Ranking). osu! has different types of beatmap-specific leaderboards, all of which, except the first one, are only available to [osu!supporters](/wiki/osu!supporter):

- Global ranking, which works across the active playerbase;
- Global ranking for every combination of [game modifiers](/wiki/Game_modifier);
- Country-specific ranking made of players bearing the same flag;
- Friend ranking that shows a player's position on the map compared to their friends.

### Charts and Spotlights

<!-- TODO: charts, as well as Chart Assembly Team, need to be referenced here when they receive a dedicated article (issue #4685) -->

<!-- TODO: would be very cool to have a separate article for osu!lazer as well (issue #4686) -->

*Main article: [Beatmap Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights)*

Since its early days, the community has had various ways to showcase unique and excellent maps. One of the first documented approaches were monthly and seasonal charts consisting of a small subset of ranked beatmaps, where top players from leaderboards displaying total score across these maps would be awarded with [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter).

The chart system has later evolved into the [Beatmap Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights) project, which now operates on similar conditions, but takes place in osu!lazer's playlists instead.

### Beatmap contests

*Main page: [Contests](/wiki/Contests)*

osu! community regularly runs different contests in order to promote creativity and award mappers who do their best. Contests range from small competitions, which are made inside local communities, to large ones that are conducted on a global scale and have breathtaking prizes. Winners often receive awards in form of [osu!supporter tags](/wiki/osu!supporter) and a themed profile badge.

### Featured Artists

*Main page: [Featured Artists](/wiki/Featured_Artists)*

Featured Artists is a community program by [osu!team](/wiki/People/The_Team) that focuses on licensing music by various artists for osu! and making it available for mapping. The website's [featured artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) showcases each involved artist and provides pre-timed templates for mapping.
